TODO
====

 *  Add a flag `--create-tables` that creates the necessary tables if they
    don't exist.

 *  Add neater error message if tables are missing, perhaps...

 *  Add a basic security measure: have a table with file names linked to rounds
    so that you can't accidentally read the same file twice.

 *  Take the filename timestamp into account

 *  Make a table for maps, perhaps
